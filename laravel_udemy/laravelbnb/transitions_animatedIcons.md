### Transitions in Vue
- Copy the basic exemple from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html) to `app.scss`.
- Use in `Availability`, for the two `<span>` messages on top of the template, with the name provided as exemple or the default name `v-enter`, `v-leave`, ect, see the animation by enterting the dates and check.

### Using font awesome animated icons
- Since we have installed font awesome, (see in file `component_star`), we can use it anywhere in the project.
- Here we use an animated loading icon, see details [animated icons](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/styling/animating-icons).
- Add an icon when it's loading after click `check`, set Network as `Slow 3G` to see the icon working.
